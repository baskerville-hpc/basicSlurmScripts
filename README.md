# Basic Slurm Scripts

As the name suggests, this is a repository containing slurm scripts that gradually build in complexity from very simple up to array jobs. They are designed for use on the University of Birmingham's Tier 2 Baskerville Facility, but should work well on any Slurm-based HPC facility.
